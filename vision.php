                    Evangel Presbyterian Church exists to extend the Kingdom of Jesus Christ.  The
                    extension  envisions  planting  of churches,
                    in Wichita and beyond,  that embrace  a Covenantal  and Reformed view of Scripture and life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    We believe that the church  is a supernatural work of God.  It is made up of individuals who were dead in trespasses and sins but who have been made alive with Christ (Ephesians 2:4-5).   Jesus said, “It is the
                    Spirit who gives life, the flesh profits nothing” (John 6:63).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    That being said, we have been given a part in the work of the church.   “We are God’s fellow workers” (I Corinthians  3:9).  God has called us to the work of building His church.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    We are called to be “the salt of the earth” to add the flavor of truth (Matthew  5:13). We are also called to be light, to shine forth
                    the glory of God into the darkness (Matthew
                    5:14-16).   We are commanded to go into all the world and preach  the gospel to all creation  and we are to make disciples,  bap - tizing them and teaching  them to know and obey God (Matthew  28:19-20; Mark 16:15).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    We are given a model for evangelism  and church  planting.   God instructed the church at Antioch to send Paul and Barnabas  out to preach,  teach,  baptize  and start  churches
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    (Acts 13:2).  They spent  their time where there were large populations and their purpose was to be seen and heard.   They sought  to be accessible  and visible like a city on a hill.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    We know that visibility saves no one, but it does enable  some to come into contact  with God’s message  of salvation.  We do not know what God will do, but we do know what we are supposed to do.  We intend,  by God’s grace, to be faithful to our calling
                    (I Peter 2:9).  In the Scriptures  we see God using His servants to proclaim His Word.
                    It is by His Word that He calls men to
                    Himself (Romans 10:13-14).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The effort and energy of ministry at Evangel has gone into the ministry of the Word.
                    We have focused on worship  first and then
                    Sunday School, small groups  (for study, fellowship and prayer)  and also one on one discipling. We will continue  this emphasis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    We believe that the Bible teaches  a shep- herd model of ministry.   This informs our current  ministry (Acts 20:28-30; I Timothy
                    5:17; II Timothy 4:2) and also our planning
                    for the future.   We believe that our calling is to live and serve together  in a Christian community  that emphasizes the rich heritage  of reformed doctrine  and worship. We also believe that it is wise to consider what God is doing and plan for the future. When Evangel grows to a size that is difficult to shepherd, we will seek God’s guidance  as to where we are to plant
                    a church.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    We will continue  to look for ways to get God’s Word out to the lost in this area and we will continue  to trust  God for the increase.  We believe God will continue
                    to bless Evangel with both spiritual  and
                    numerical  growth; we will plan for that growth.
                    </p>
