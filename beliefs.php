                            <p>We further believe that the constitution of the Presbyterian Church in America (PCA), including the Westminster Confession of Faith and the Larger and Shorter Catechisms, faithfully summarizes and represents this system of doctrine and polity either explicitly or, by good and necessary consequence, can be deduced from the Bible.</p>
                            <p>We believe the Scriptures teach that God deals with man covenantally, and this doctrine, known as Covenant Theology, has special relevance for the faith and order of the church.</p>
